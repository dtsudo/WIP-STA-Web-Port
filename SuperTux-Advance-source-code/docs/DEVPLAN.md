# Development Plans

## Characters

* **Midi**: Midi has bombs, which will change element with each elemental powerup, fire, ice, and lightning, and can be fired in eight directions. Earth form replaces his bombs with stone boomerangs. His appearance remains the same with all elements. Rather than depend on flight, levels will be designed with alternative paths for Midi that include monkey bars/vines for him to climb across on. He can also plant mines by shooting directly down while on the ground, and jump from them to detonate them and launch himself into the air. The sneak button will make Midi hold still so he can aim around without having to move.

  Double tapping down or sliding into a narrow space will make him curl into his transphere, which behaves like the morphball from Metroid, except that it responds to slopes and only appears to be rolling when in motion. Bombs can be dropped in this form, and will behave like they do in Metroid, defying gravity and exploding after a short time. Due to limited energy, infinite bomb jumping can't be done.

## Enemies

* **Snail**: Works like a koopa troopa. Red will walk off edges, blue will turn around, and punkle will climb walls.

## Bosses

* **Mega Python**: Giant version of the PyGame mascot. Moves around the arena similar to the player in snake games. Damage it by tricking it into biting its own tail.

* **Servalot**: Works like Metal Sonic's fight where you have to race him to the end.

* **IKA IKA**: A tiki mask that switches between fire and ice forms. It can only be harmed by using the opposite element. It shoots orbs fo fire and ice in a bullet hell fashion.

## Two-Player Mode

Two-player mode will be a local co-op mode allowing a second player to join in and control either a second character. One- and two-player modes can be enabled in the overworld pause menu by selecting a second character, and disabled by selecting nobody. Selecting nobody will set the second player's character ID to an ampty string.

Players will have separate health and energy, but will share upgrades. Item boxes will carry two items, releasing one for each player. If a single player manages to get both items anyway, a new key will be added to let them share swapped items.

When together, players will have arrows over their head indicating which character is controlled by which player. When far from each other, the game will switch to split screen. Each player will see the other player still with an arrow, but won't need their own on their respective screen.

## Lore

As there is no "canon" SuperTux universe, this game aims to consolidate the different takes on Tux's worlds and explain how games like SuperTux, SuperTuxKart, and SuperTux Advance share the same world. As classic SuperTux does not feature other mascots, but STK does, the explanation here is that due to Nolok's tampering with dark magics, beings from other worlds began to get pulled into the alternate Earth seen in STK. For now, despite it being in meta context, they are still called mascots.

This leads into the events of STK, wherein Nolok captures the defacto leader of the displaced mascots to try to gain power over them. As per usual, his motive is purely his love of causing trouble, hence his use of a grand prix instead of full-on combat to win Gnu's freedom. In STA, he ramps this up by capturing many of the mascots to make Tux trek all over the world for them, as after being beaten by Tux when he captured Penny, Nolok has found a fond rivalry in Tux that he wishes to challenge in any way he can, though Tux clearly does not feel the same way.

Come the events of STA, Penny has founded a town to house as many displaced beings as she can, but the town was ransacked by Nolok's new minions, denizens of the Shitake Dynasty. Their leader, Empress Plum, has offered her hand in marriage if Nolok can finally defeat Tux. Her motive is simple as well: ruling a kingdom is boring, and she wants some action, and a villain like Nolok seems like the perfect source.
